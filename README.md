# SohailRahman.net website

Technologies used:
- Vue
- Vuetify
- ButterCMS
- Firebase
- HTML/CSS/JS

Got a few bits to do that I am going to note here for future reference:
- Use Google Analytics for insights
- Add a section for Useful links 
- Use Vue Router to be a SPA.
- Password protected section for hosting personal files (Maybe use AWS Cognito or Okta)
